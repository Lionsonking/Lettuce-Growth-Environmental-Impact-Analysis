# Lettuce-Growth-Environmental-Impact-Analysis
## This analysis evaluated the environmental factors influencing the growth duration (Growth Day) of 3169 lettuce plants, using a dataset with measurements of Temperature, Humidity, pH Level, TDS Value (ppm), and Growth Day, collected from at least August to September, and possibly longer. The study aimed to identify optimal conditions to enhance lettuce growth and quality by addressing three SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) questions, while also exploring additional variables (Humidity, pH) and temporal trends in Temperature.
## Key findings emerged from the data. Temperature showed fluctuations over time, suggesting seasonal or daily patterns that could impact growth rates. Humidity and pH were analyzed as additional variables, revealing their potential influence on Growth Day alongside the primary factors. For instance, deviations in pH or Humidity levels might correlate with slower or faster growth, offering clues for condition adjustments. TDS Value (ppm), a measure of nutrient concentration, was also assessed, though its specific impact depended on its interaction with other variables like Temperature.
## The analysis provided actionable insights for optimizing lettuce cultivation. By identifying how these environmental factors—Temperature, Humidity, pH, and TDS—affect Growth Day, growers can adjust conditions to shorten growth cycles or improve plant quality. For example, maintaining stable Temperature and pH within ideal ranges could enhance consistency, while fine-tuning Humidity might mitigate stress on plants. Temporal trends in Temperature further suggest the need for adaptive strategies across seasons.
## Spanning at least two months, the dataset offered a robust sample to draw conclusions, though extending the timeframe could strengthen findings. Overall, this study bridges data-driven analysis with practical agriculture, equipping growers with insights to refine environmental controls and boost lettuce production efficiency.
